# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
Making the diagonal scores were harder because it was a complex than the regular straight scores

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I believe a randomizer would work best, it would simply choose a spot that has not been chosen already. A more advanced computer would stratically choose it's spots than at random.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

Here I would apply real-based strategies like placing a spot at a corner and placing another spot where the opponent cannot stop both winning lines that connect the two spots.
